  <h1># Humidity_Observer</h1>
<div>This project is still in progress!
  <hr>I wanted to have the Voron-Style on my drybox so this idea came up. Case to place a humidity sensor in a storage box and keep the box sealed from air and humidity.

  <br>All parts except the seal are printed in <B>ABS</B> (esun ABS+ following the Voron print guidelines - 40% infill) and the seal in <B>TPU</B> (Bavaria Filaments TPU98) the shrinkage of ABS is been observed. I recommend using support for the (a)_outter_thermo_case and print it as it is oriented in the .stl file.

  The Hygrometer has to be pressed hard in the case, that's why I recommend not printing in PLA, the case could break while doing this. You have to drill or cut a 45mm hole in your box to fit the whole thing.
