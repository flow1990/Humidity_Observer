This project is still in progress!

I am going to upload a full readme plus pictures soon.

I printed all parts except the seal in ABS (esun ABS+ following the Voron print guidelines) and the seal in <B>TPU</B> (Bavaria Filaments TPU98, 0.1mm layer height, 0% concentric infill and 1 top/bottom layer).

Bill of materials:
<br>2 x Threaded Insert M3 x D5.0 x L4.0 (aliexpress: https://a.aliexpress.com/_mNUmqR0)
<br>1 x 2In1 Thermometer Hygrometer Mini LCD (aliexpress: https://a.aliexpress.com/_ms3GsKA)
<br>2 x SHCS M3 x 8mm (depends on thickness of your box walls)
