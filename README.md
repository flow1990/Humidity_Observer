# Humidity_Observer
Case to place a humidity sensor in storage box and keep the box sealed from air and humidity.

This project is still in progress!

I am going to upload a full readme plus pictures soon.

I printed all parts except the seal in ABS (esun ABS+ following the Voron print guidelines) and the seal in TPU (Bavaria Filaments TPU98, 0.1mm layer height, 0% concentric infill and 1 top/bottom layer).

Bill of materials:
\n2 x Threaded Insert M3 x D5.0 x L4.0 (aliexpress: https://a.aliexpress.com/_mNUmqR0)
\n1 x 2In1 Thermometer Hygrometer Mini LCD (aliexpress: https://a.aliexpress.com/_ms3GsKA)
\n2 x SHCS M3 x 8 (depends on thickness of your box walls)
